# Android box

The `yinghau76/android` box runs on ubuntu 12.04 and provides a selection of the Android toolchain:

* gradle 2.2
* android sdk version 24
* android build tools 21
* android API 21 (android 5.0)
* android support library
* google play service repository

The box also inherits tools from a not yet official java box, resulting in the following additional tools:

* oracle java 7
* ant and ivy
* maven

A typical android application can use the following yaml:

``` yaml
box: yinghau76/android
# Build definition
build:
  # The steps that will be executed on build
  steps:
    - script:
        name: show base information
        code: |
          gradle -v
          echo $ANDROID_HOME
          echo $ANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS
          echo $ANDROID_UPDATE_FILTER
    # A step that executes `gradle build` command
    - script:
        name: run gradle
        code: |
          gradle --full-stacktrace -q --project-cache-dir=$WERCKER_CACHE_DIR build
```

There are a number of environment varaibles declared for your information:

* ANDROID_SDK_VERSION : version of the sdk
* ANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS : which versions of the build tools are installed.
* ANDROID_UPDATE_FILTER : shows all sdk elements which are installed
